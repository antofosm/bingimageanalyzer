Bing Aerial Imagery Analyzer for OpenStreetMap
===========================================================================
This web application is a fork of mvexel's Bing Aerial Imagery Analyzer for 
OpenStreetMap [1]. It shows the Bing satellite and aerial photos overlaid with 
red/green coloured tiles indicating availability of high resolution imagery. 
If zoomed in to zoom level 14 or more, the page checks whether the requested 
tiles contain hires imagery and paints them green if they do and red if they 
do not. This is visualized in a mosaic kind of way when you zoom out to lower 
zoom levels.

Thanks to Pavel Shramov[2] for providing Bing/Leafpad integration.
